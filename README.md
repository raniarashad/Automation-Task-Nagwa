# Automation-Task-Nagwa
I used the Java programming language to do this task.
Eclipse as IDE - Selenium Webdriver.
Maven project, TestNG for running, annotations, and reporting the test result, Cucumber, and POM structure.
To run the script, Go to the Testng.xml file and run it as TestNG or you can use the test runner class to run the script using the cucumber.
After running the script, you should enter the Website URL on the console.
The script supports multiple browsers, You can run the script in Firefox and Chrome by adding the browser name from the TestNG file before running the script.
Screenshots are taken automatically if there is a failure during the running.
The project will run correctly once you import it into your machine.
